You communicate to this computer with a terminal - will also be called a console, screen CRT, VDT, CON, TTY
Terminal is composed of a monitor (which is also a type of program) and a keyboard
CP/M allows you to name programs and call programs by name
A small microcomputer system usually consists of a console terminal, computer with CPU and memory, a floppy disk system, and a line printer
Consoles started with a switches-and-lights system, but quickly evolved into teletype systems, such as the ASR-33
Early storage systems consisted of paper punch machines
A CPU (central processing unit) forms the basis of every computer, and it processes data from different parts of the computer
The Intel 8080 microprocessor's instruction set became standard for future projects in the industry. This is why the 8085 the book talks about runs with the same instruction set
The 8085 takes a 5-volt DC power source to use
Microprocessors are a integrated circuit (IC)
opcodes = operation codes
Programs are formatted in bytes
Small programs in read-only memory (ROM) allow you to automatically load a program without keying it in
Read-Write Memory (RAM) is used to process changes to bit patterns
A PROM (Programmable ROM) is an IC with no saved program, which you then hardcode a program into that cannot be removed
EPROMs (Erasable PROM) allow you to erase a program once it has been burned into the PROM
Process: a ROM with a loader program is stored in ROM, which reads the program into RAM, which then interacts with an I/O mass storage device
8085 microprocessor can address 65536 bytes of memory (64 Kilobytes)
Main storage on this machine is two floppy disks with between 70k and several million bytes
Data on floppy disks is broken into circular tracks, each with its own sector, which has an address
Data in sectors is broken into a string of data bytes, with the standard CP/M having 128 bytes per sector
CP/M takes care of most addressing tasks; all a programmer needs to know is the name of the file they want, and which drive it's on
