CRTs are CONs when set up properly
Disk names match up with each other in the system (0=A:, 1=B:)
There are four logical devices that CP/M uses
CON logical device is the console
Liner printers (LPT) are connected as LST (listing devices)
RDR and PUN are general purpose input and output devices
Each logical device can be connected to a variety of physical devices
IOBYT is a one-byte memory location for switching between physical devices
The CON is the only bi-directional logical device
Some physical devices may need to be configured in more than one logical device

Each file name is up to 8 characters in length
File names are appended by a .TYP in general form, although the period may not be shown if the file is examined using the DIR command
.ASM denotes an assembly language source program, while .COM denotes a command file which execute part of the file name following a "<"
You can create your own file types as long as they don't interfere with other conventions
CP/M can create and delete files from user code
New file types can be used to as "labels" to designate groups of files
The command DIR lists all files on the current disk, while DIR*.COM lists all .COM files
THe "*" symbol acts as a placeholder for any file name
