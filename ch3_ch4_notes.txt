CRTs are CONs when set up properly
Disk names match up with each other in the system (0=A:, 1=B:)
There are four logical devices that CP/M uses
CON logical device is the console
Liner printers (LPT) are connected as LST (listing devices)
RDR and PUN are general purpose input and output devices
Each logical device can be connected to a variety of physical devices
IOBYT is a one-byte memory location for switching between physical devices
The CON is the only bi-directional logical device
Some physical devices may need to be configured in more than one logical device

Each file name is up to 8 characters in length
File names are appended by a .TYP in general form, although the period may not be shown if the file is examined using the DIR command
.ASM denotes an assembly language source program, while .COM denotes a command file which execute part of the file name following a "<"
You can create your own file types as long as they don't interfere with other conventions
CP/M can create and delete files from user code
New file types can be used to as "labels" to designate groups of files
The command DIR lists all files on the current disk, while DIR*.COM lists all .COM files
A carriage return is assumed after each command
THe "*" symbol acts as a placeholder for any file name
The "?" symbol can also be used, where the number of symbols indicates the greatest number of characters in the file name
*.* will locate any file with any type in the specified directory
PIP is the peripheral exchange program
DIR L*.ASM and DIR LIFE????.ASM will both locate the file named Life-1.ASM
PIP B:=A:*.* will copy all files from disk drive A into disk drive B
PIP PUN:=FILENAME.TYP will send the specified file name to the physical device attached to the PUN logical device
In CP/M's command line, you can back one character with the delete/backspace key
If the CP/M version does not allow backing up, the character to be deleted will be repeated
Entering CTRL+R will repeat the line with the correct edits to the next line
CTRL+U or CTRL+X will abort the current line
