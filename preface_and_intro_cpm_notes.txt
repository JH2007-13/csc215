||| Preface |||
Assembly is far more based in machine code than other languages of the time
Each new computer is coded differently
CP/M uses routines to simplify coding
CP/M makes it easier to communicate with input/output devices and storage
The guide will teach us how to make a library of subroutines, which will allow us to create more complex programs

||| Introduction |||
"cr" symbol is the equivelant of the return key on keyboard
The first program is a debugging tool that displayed a "$" to the console - good for testing operation
Assembly uses some of the same mnemonics as the basic Altair programming
WCONF = Write-on-the-Console function
ED.COM is assembled by ASM.COM
The debugger (DDT) can be used for very short programs, but the assembler is used for anything longer
Intro program is an example of interfacing with the input/output (I/0) devices
Assembly language can reduce program size and therefore cost, and also run faster than higher-level programs
Required items: CP/M based computer, complete CP/M system disk, and a clean disk for experimenting.
